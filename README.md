# Temporal Convolutional Block with Bahdanau Attention

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Temporal Convolutional Block (TCN) enhanced with the Bahdanau Attention mechanism. TCNs offer powerful sequence modeling capabilities due to their ability to process long sequences and achieve expansive receptive fields. Incorporating attention mechanisms ensures the model captures not just temporal dependencies but also emphasizes important parts of the sequence.

## Key Components

1. **Causal Convolution (`CausalDWConv1D`):** 
   - Guarantees the causality of convolution operations to maintain the temporal order of sequences.
   
2. **Batch Normalization and Activation:**
   - Stabilizes the model's activations.

3. **Efficient Channel Attention (`ECA`):**
   - Implements channel-wise attention, emphasizing specific channels based on input.

4. **Bahdanau Attention:**
   - Weighs different parts/timesteps of the sequence to allow the model to focus on specific sequence parts when producing an output.

5. **Pointwise Convolution:**
   - Adjusts the dimensionality of the output, acting as a feature transformation mechanism.

6. **Residual Connection:**
   - Counters the vanishing gradient problem common in deep networks, often resulting in faster convergence.

## Usage

To incorporate the TCN block with Bahdanau Attention into your architecture, instantiate and use it like any Keras layer:

```python
x = TCNBlock(filters, kernel_size, dilation_rate)(input_tensor)
```



## Parameters to Define

When you're using this block, make sure you define the key parameters:

- `filters`: Specifies the dimensionality of the output space (i.e., the number of output filters in the convolution).
  
- `kernel_size`: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the length of the 1D convolution window.
  
- `dilation_rate`: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.

## Tips & Recommendations

- **Positioning:** For best results, place the TCN block in your model where it can make full use of its expansive receptive field combined with the attention mechanism.
  
- **Performance Concerns:** Remember that attention mechanisms can be resource-intensive. Regularly monitor your training times and adjust as required.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Different datasets may benefit from different configurations. Regularly test and tweak parameters such as attention units, `filters`, `kernel_size`, and `dilation_rate`.
  
- **Attention Visualization:** A peek into the attention weights can offer critical insights. Visualize them to understand which parts of the sequence your model finds most important.
  
- **Training Stability:** Deep networks can sometimes be unstable in training. If you encounter such issues, consider using gradient clipping or explore other stabilization methods.
  
- **Model Complexity:** The added attention mechanism increases the complexity of the TCN block. Ensure you have a sufficiently large and diverse dataset for training to counteract potential overfitting.
